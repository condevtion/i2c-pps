# Project Log

## 2026-02-27
Finalize schematics design
## 2026-02-26
Design the digital I/O circuit
## 2026-02-25
Dedigned the master switch and relaxed requirements on the input filter components
## 2026-02-24
Designed the output filter and sensor schematic
## 2026-02-23
Designed the input filter and sensor schematic
## 2026-02-22
Designed the programming and controller and power stage schematics
## 2026-02-21
Created a boilerplate for the whole devices schematics. Including a set of pages for different parts of the device, a set of main networks and busses, and connections between them. Decided on network nameing.
## 2026-02-19
Added symbol and footprints for the BQ25756S controller to the schematic repository.
## 2026-02-18
Started a repository for HW schematics - [github.com/vasili-v/i2c-pps-hw](https://github.com/vasili-v/i2c-pps-hw).
## 2026-02-17
Found [BQ25756 design calculator](https://www.ti.com/product/BQ25758A#design-tools-simulation) and [BQ25758 Schematic and Layout Checklist](https://e2e.ti.com/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/196/BQ25758-Schematic-And-Layout-Checklist.pdf) for the IC. These allowed to narrow down specifications. Selected major components for the power stage and resistor values for sensors and programming.
## 2026-02-15
Created the repository. Selected main power supply controller - Texas Instruments [BQ25758S](https://www.ti.com/product/BQ25758S). Found evaluation board [BQ25758AEVM](https://www.ti.com/tool/BQ25758AEVM) and application note
[MOSFET Selection Guide for BQ2575x Family](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sluaax9/sluaax9.pdf).
