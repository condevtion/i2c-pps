Found [BQ25756 design calculator](https://www.ti.com/product/BQ25758A#design-tools-simulation) and [BQ25758 Schematic and Layout Checklist](https://e2e.ti.com/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-discussions-components-files/196/BQ25758-Schematic-And-Layout-Checklist.pdf) for the IC. These allowed to narrow down specifications. Selected major components for the power stage and resistor values for sensors and programming.
